# ArbitrageX AI Agent Architecture

## Overview

ArbitrageX is an AI-powered deal sourcing engine for private equity firms that automates the identification of investment opportunities. This document outlines the agent architecture for the MVP, focusing on leveraging AI agents to process unstructured data from web sources and provide actionable investment insights.

## Agent Architecture

The ArbitrageX MVP will utilize a multi-agent system with specialized roles to handle different aspects of the deal sourcing process. Each agent is designed to perform specific tasks while collaborating with other agents to achieve the overall goal.

### 1. Orchestrator Agent

**Role**: Central coordinator that manages the workflow between all other agents.

**Responsibilities**:
- Interpret user inputs (CSV data, investment strategy)
- Coordinate task distribution among specialized agents
- Monitor overall system performance
- Handle error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Provide progress updates to the UI

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implemented as a stateful agent with task queue management
- Uses event-driven architecture to communicate with other agents
- Maintains context across the entire workflow

### 2. Data Ingestion Agent

**Role**: Handles all data input operations and initial preprocessing.

**Responsibilities**:
- Process CSV uploads of target companies/industries
- Parse investment strategy documents
- Validate and clean input data
- Extract key parameters for search operations
- Convert unstructured inputs into structured search queries

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses pandas for CSV processing
- Implements document parsing for strategy uploads
- Performs initial entity extraction and classification

### 3. Search Agent

**Role**: Performs targeted web searches to identify relevant information sources.

**Responsibilities**:
- Generate optimized search queries based on target companies and investment criteria
- Execute web searches using free search APIs (SerpAPI free tier, Google Custom Search API)
- Filter search results for relevance
- Prioritize sources based on credibility and recency
- Identify high-value pages for detailed crawling

**Technical Implementation**:
- Utilizes search API wrappers
- Implements query optimization algorithms
- Uses NLP for relevance scoring of search results

### 4. Web Crawler Agent

**Role**: Extracts detailed information from identified web pages.

**Responsibilities**:
- Navigate to and scrape content from prioritized URLs
- Handle different website structures and formats
- Extract relevant company information (financials, leadership, news)
- Manage rate limiting and respect robots.txt
- Detect and extract embedded data (tables, charts)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Built on Scrapy or BeautifulSoup
- Implements headless browser capabilities for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Uses rotating user agents and proxy management
- Includes error handling for failed requests

### 5. Information Extraction Agent

**Role**: Processes raw scraped content into structured, usable data.

**Responsibilities**:
- Extract key entities and relationships from text
- Identify financial metrics and performance indicators
- Recognize company events (acquisitions, leadership changes)
- Standardize extracted information into consistent format
- Filter out irrelevant information

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses open-source NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK)
- Implements named entity recognition
- Uses regex patterns for financial data extraction
- Applies text classification for relevance filtering

### 6. Analysis Agent

**Role**: Evaluates companies against investment criteria and generates insights.

**Responsibilities**:
- Compare extracted company data against investment strategy
- Calculate relevance and opportunity scores
- Identify potential synergies for add-on acquisitions
- Generate explanations for recommendations
- Rank opportunities based on custom scoring algorithms

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implements vector similarity search
- Uses rule-based and ML-based scoring systems
- Generates natural language explanations
- Maintains audit trail of decision factors

### 7. Storage Agent

**Role**: Manages data persistence and retrieval operations.

**Responsibilities**:
- Convert processed data into vector embeddings
- Store data in vector database
- Handle data versioning and updates
- Provide efficient query capabilities
- Maintain data relationships and context

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses open-source vector databases (Chroma, FAISS)
- Implements embedding generation using open-source models
- Provides API for data retrieval and updates

### 8. UI Agent

**Role**: Handles user interface interactions and data presentation.

**Responsibilities**:
- Present results in an intuitive interface
- Handle user interactions and feedback
- Generate visualizations of company relationships
- Provide explanations for recommendations
- Support filtering and sorting of results

**Technical Implementation**:
- Integrates with frontend framework
- Implements reactive data updates
- Generates dynamic visualizations
- Provides natural language explanations

## Agent Communication Flow

1. **User Input** → **Orchestrator** → **Data Ingestion Agent**
2. **Data Ingestion Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **Search Agent**
3. **Search Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **Web Crawler Agent**
4. **Web Crawler Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **Information Extraction Agent**
5. **Information Extraction Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **Storage Agent**
6. **Storage Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **Analysis Agent**
7. **Analysis Agent** → **Orchestrator** → **UI Agent**
8. **UI Agent** → **User**

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Synchronous Interactions
- Data Ingestion → Search (requires complete input processing)
- Information Extraction → Storage (requires complete extraction)
- Storage → Analysis (requires vector embeddings)

### Asynchronous Interactions
- Search → Web Crawler (can process results as they arrive)
- Web Crawler → Information Extraction (can process pages incrementally)
- Analysis → UI (can update results progressively)

## Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Search Fallback**: If primary search API fails, switch to alternative free APIs
2. **Crawling Fallback**: If direct scraping fails, attempt archive.org or cached versions
3. **Extraction Fallback**: If NLP extraction fails, fall back to keyword-based extraction
4. **Storage Fallback**: If vector DB operations fail, use temporary file-based storage

## Technical Considerations

### Open Source and Free Tools
- **Embedding Models**: Sentence-Transformers, BERT (Hugging Face)
- **Vector Database**: Chroma, FAISS, or SQLite with vector extensions
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **Search APIs**: SerpAPI free tier, Google Custom Search API (limited free quota)
- **NLP Processing**: spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers

### Scalability Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- Use caching to reduce redundant operations
- Design for horizontal scaling of independent agents
- Implement batch processing for large datasets

### Security and Compliance
- Respect robots.txt and website terms of service
- Implement proper rate limiting for web crawling
- Store only processed data, not raw scraped content
- Anonymize sensitive information in storage
