## Technical Debt Management

To ensure a successful MVP while acknowledging the time constraints of a hackathon, the following technical debt management strategy will be implemented:

### Acceptable Technical Debt

1. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - Focus on critical path testing only
   - Defer comprehensive unit tests
   - Use manual testing for non-critical paths

2. **Simplified Error Handling**
   - Implement basic error handling for critical paths
   - Use generic error responses for edge cases
   - Defer comprehensive error recovery

3. **Limited Optimization**
   - Accept non-optimal performance for non-critical operations
   - Defer database query optimization except for critical paths
   - Accept larger bundle sizes for frontend

4. **Reduced Feature Scope**
   - Implement core features fully
   - Create UI placeholders for secondary features
   - Use simulated data for non-essential visualizations

### Technical Debt to Avoid

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Never skip input validation
   - Always implement basic authentication
   - Never expose sensitive data

2. **Data Corruption Risks**
   - Ensure proper data validation before storage
   - Implement transaction handling for critical operations
   - Create data backups before major operations

3. **Unmaintainable Architecture**
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Document key architectural decisions
   - Use consistent naming conventions

4. **Deployment Blockers**
   - Ensure system can be demonstrated
   - Test deployment process early
   - Have fallback options for critical features

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - **Risk**: External search APIs may have rate limits that restrict usage
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching, use multiple API providers, prepare mock data

2. **Complex Web Scraping**
   - **Risk**: Some websites may be difficult to scrape due to JavaScript or anti-scraping measures
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on simpler sites first, prepare pre-scraped data as fallback

3. **Performance Issues with Vector Search**
   - **Risk**: Vector operations may be slow with large datasets
   - **Mitigation**: Limit dataset size for demo, implement efficient filtering before vector search

4. **Integration Challenges**
   - **Risk**: Components developed in parallel may have integration issues
   - **Mitigation**: Define clear interfaces early, schedule regular integration checkpoints

5. **Time Management**
   - **Risk**: Certain components may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize features, have simplified versions ready, prepare feature toggles

## Contingency Plans

### Plan B Options for Critical Features

1. **If Web Crawling Fails**
   - Use pre-downloaded content
   - Simulate crawling results with prepared data
   - Focus demo on other features

2. **If Vector Search is Too Slow**
   - Reduce dataset size
   - Pre-compute results for demo scenarios
   - Use simplified matching algorithm

3. **If UI Development Falls Behind**
   - Focus on core screens only
   - Use simplified layouts
   - Leverage UI component libraries more heavily

4. **If Integration Issues Arise**
   - Isolate components for demonstration
   - Use mock interfaces between components
   - Focus demo on working subsystems
